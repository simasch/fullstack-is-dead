# Vaadin

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

## Running the application

Open the project in an IDE. You can download the [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download) if you do not have a suitable IDE already.
Once opened in the IDE, locate the `Application` class and run the main method using "Debug".

For more information on installing in various IDEs, see [how to import Vaadin projects to different IDEs](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/getting-started/import).

If you install the Vaadin plugin for IntelliJ, you should instead launch the `Application` class using "Debug using HotswapAgent" to see updates in the Java code immediately reflected in the browser.

## Deploying to Production

The project is a standard Maven project. To create a production build, call 

```
./mvnw clean package -Pproduction
```

If you have Maven globally installed, you can replace `./mvnw` with `mvn`.

This will build a JAR file with all the dependencies and front-end resources,ready to be run. The file can be found in the `target` folder after the build completes.
You then launch the application using 
```
java -jar target/vaadin-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
