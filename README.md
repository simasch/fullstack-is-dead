# Full-stack development is dead, long live full-stack development!

This sample projects demonstrates the use of Vaadin, Hilla, Thymeleaf, and JTE.

## Run the samples

You can simply execute

    mvnw spring-boot:run

in the four project folders.

## Ports

| Project   | Port | URL                   |
|-----------|------|-----------------------|
| Vaadin    | 8081 | http://localhost:8081 |
| Hilla     | 8082 | http://localhost:8082 |
| Thymeleaf | 8083 | http://localhost:8083 |
| JTE       | 8084 | http://localhost:8084 |

## Important!

If you run the apps from IntelliJ, make sure to set the working directory to the root folder of the project (JTE for
example). Otherwise, the resources won't be found.
